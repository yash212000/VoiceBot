# VoiceBot
Voice bot that can respond to the questions as I would respond to them.

Submitted by - Yash Vardhan Goel 

Step 1 ->
Install the requirements using -> pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2 ->
Get a open ai api key and make sure they key works.

Step 3 ->
execute main.py, you will be prompted to enter openai api key which you should paste and press enter.

Step 4 ->
Interact with the bot, current listening time is 5 sec, you can change this by changing 'DURATION' variable in the code

Step 5 ->
Stop the code execution once you are done interacting with the bot

# Some important points:
1. Make sure the API key you are using has credits and is working properly.
2. Install all the requirements mentioned in requirements.txt
3. I have included some background about me so that it can answer questions as if I am answering.
4. The input.wav and response.mp3 file are created on its own during execution, we don't have to provide that as input. The voice bot is completely automated.
5. One another way of creating voice bot very easily is using ready-made APIs like elevenlab (along with openai api) but that would defy the purpose of development hence I have sticked to the basics and created the bot just with chatgpt's api.

Refer to the video recording for better understanding of how to run the code.
